# Express-O-Cafe

Express-O Cafe is an information system created to help businesses and process transactions in a cafe. This application also uses data that has been integrated with the database. In addition, there is also a distribution of access rights for each employee who logs in according to the position of each employee. The theme used in this application has also been adapted to the themes commonly used in a cafe. Through this application, all kinds of transactions and profits obtained by the Cafe will also be recorded and physical evidence can be seen in the form of receipts and monthly and annual reports.

Every data regarding the business processes that occur in the Café will be recorded in the database so that the data will be more secure. Apart from that, there is also a distribution of access rights for each employee that is made so that the data in the database cannot be changed or manipulated by employees who do not have access rights to certain parts. Transaction data that occurs at the Café will also be recorded automatically in the database, and the history of transactions that occur can also be viewed easily through this application. In addition, evidence of each transaction that occurs can also be seen physically through a receipt that will be printed automatically for each transaction that occurs. For those of you who also want to see profits and what menus are selling the most, this application also provides an annual/monthly report feature. This report will show you important things, such as the best-selling menus, Café profits, and the number of transactions that occur, both on a monthly and annual basis.
